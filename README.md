This is a Rainmeter fileset to allow stocks to be a dynamic desktop,
self-updating throughout the day. Instead of having to navigate to a website
for a particular day's closing prices or indexes, all one now has to do is
minimize their windows. Aesthetics definitely do matter, so there will be a
stock ticker, a watchlist, and a notes panel on the side, all in the same theme.

Stocks.txt is how you can add new stocks to your desktop. Add the exchange, a
colon, and the stock ticker, and refresh rainmeter so it will show up. Be
careful not to add too many, rainmeter can respond in adverse ways.

This program is a permutation of Mordasius's work. All credit for the original
logic goes to him. Honestly, really impressive stuff.
